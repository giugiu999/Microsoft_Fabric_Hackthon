      "### General Tips to Improve Efficiency:\n",
      "1. **Active Learning:**\n",
      "   - Don’t just passively read or watch videos. Engage actively by solving problems, taking notes, and teaching concepts to someone else.\n",
      "   \n",
      "2. **Spaced Repetition:**\n",
      "   - Review what you've learned regularly rather than cramming the night before. Use tools like Anki or Quizlet to create flashcards for important concepts.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Pomodoro Technique:**\n",
      "   - Break study sessions into intervals of 25 minutes of focused study followed by 5-minute breaks. Every four intervals, take a longer break (15-30 minutes).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Healthy Study Habits:**\n",
      "   - Ensure you get adequate sleep, nutrition, and exercise. Study in a quiet, organized environment without distractions.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Assess and Adjust:**\n",
      "   - Periodically assess your understanding and adjust your plan if a particular topic needs more attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me know if you need any further assistance or adjustments!\n"
